# Data-607-Project-2

For this project I will be analyzing the Nobel Peace Prize data and answering the following questions:

- How have the number of awards given out each year changed over time? (Need year and award type)

- Which field has received the largest prize amount? Which field has received the lowest?

- What proportion of the awards are given to women vs men? How has this changed over time? Need to plot time vs gender

I will be splitting the data into multiple tables for awards and laureates.

(e.g., awardYear, category, prizeAmount) and laureates (e.g., name, birth_date, gender)
